INSTRUCTIONS

Your task is to implement an in-memory cache of order objects that supports
adding new orders, removing existing orders and matching buy and sell orders.

- An "order" is a request to buy or sell a financial security (eg. bond, stock,
  commodity, etc.).
- Each order is uniquely identified by an order id.
- Each security has a different security id.
- Order matching occurs for orders with the same security id, different side
  (buy or sell), and different company (company of person who requested the
  order).

Provide an implementation for the OrderCacheInterface class in OrderCache.h:

- An Order class is provided for you:
  - This class holds basic order info.
  - Do not remove the provided member variables and methods in the Order class.
  - You may add additional members if you like.
  - For your implementation of OrderCacheInterface:
    - Write a class that derives OrderCacheInterface.
    - Choose appropriate data structure(s) to hold Order objects and any
      additional data you'd like.
    - Implement the following methods (do not change their signatures)
      - addOrder()
      - cancelOrder()
      - cancelOrdersForUser()
      - cancelOrdersForSecIdWithMinimumQty()
      - getMatchingSizeForSecurity()
      - getAllOrders()
    - Add any additional methods and variables you'd like to your class.

- There are more comments in OrderCache.h to provide additional guidance.

- Submit all files as email attachments or as .zip file. You do not need to
  submit a main() or an executable. We will build an executable using your
  submitted code for implementing the OrderCacheInterface class to run tests.

- Before submitting, test your implementation using the included unit tests.
  See TESTING.txt for more informaton on how to run the tests.

- Use up to C++17. Your code must compile. Code should be platform agnostic.

- Single-threaded support is sufficient. Adding thread safety is not necessary
  but would be viewed as extra credit.

- Order matching rules for getMatchingSizeForSecurity()
  - Your implementation of getMatchingSizeForSecurity() should give the total
    qty that can match for a security id
  - Can only match orders with the same security id
  - Can only match a Buy order with a Sell order
  - Buy order can match against multiple Sell orders (and vice versa)
    - eg a security id "ABCD" has
      Buy  order with qty 10000
      Sell order with qty  2000
      Sell order with qty  1000
    - security id "ABCD" has a total match of 3000. The Buy order's qty is big
      enough to match against both Sell orders and still has 7000 remaining
  - Any order quantity already allocated to a match cannot be reused as a match
    against a different order (eg the qty 3000 matched above for security id
    "ABCD" example)
  - Some orders may not match entirely or at all
  - Users in the same company cannot match against each other

EXAMPLE 1

Order matching example and explanation.

Example set of orders added using addOrder()
  OrdId1 SecId1 Buy  1000 User1 CompanyA
  OrdId2 SecId2 Sell 3000 User2 CompanyB
  OrdId3 SecId1 Sell  500 User3 CompanyA
  OrdId4 SecId2 Buy   600 User4 CompanyC
  OrdId5 SecId2 Buy   100 User5 CompanyB
  OrdId6 SecId3 Buy  1000 User6 CompanyD
  OrdId7 SecId2 Buy  2000 User7 CompanyE
  OrdId8 SecId2 Sell 5000 User8 CompanyE

Explanation
- SecId1
  - SecId1 has 1 Buy order and 1 Sell order
  - Both orders are for users in CompanyA so they are not allowed to match
  - There are no matches for SecId1
- SecId2
  - OrdId2 matches quantity 600 against OrdId4
  - OrdId2 matches quantity 2000 against OrdId7
  - OrdId2 has a total matched quantity of 2600
  - OrdId8 matches quantity 100 against OrdId5 only
  - OrdId8 has a remaining qty of 4900
  - OrdId4 had its quantity fully allocated to match OrdId2
  - No remaining qty on OrdId4 for the remaining 4900 of OrdId8
  - Total quantity matched for SecId2 is 2700. (2600 + 100)
  - Note: there are other combinations of matches among the orders which would
    lead to the same result of 2700 total qty matching
- SecId3 has only one Buy order, no other orders to match against

EXAMPLE 2:

  Orders in cache:
      OrdId1  SecId1 Sell  100 User10 Company2
      OrdId2  SecId3 Sell  200 User8  Company2
      OrdId3  SecId1 Buy   300 User13 Company2
      OrdId4  SecId2 Sell  400 User12 Company2
      OrdId5  SecId3 Sell  500 User7  Company2
      OrdId6  SecId3 Buy   600 User3  Company1
      OrdId7  SecId1 Sell  700 User10 Company2
      OrdId8  SecId1 Sell  800 User2  Company1
      OrdId9  SecId2 Buy   900 User6  Company2
      OrdId10 SecId2 Sell 1000 User5  Company1
      OrdId11 SecId1 Sell 1100 User13 Company2
      OrdId12 SecId2 Buy  1200 User9  Company2
      OrdId13 SecId1 Sell 1300 User1  Company

  Total qty matching for security ids:
      SecId1 300
      SecId2 1000
      SecId3 600

EXAMPLE 3:

  Orders in cache:
      OrdId1  SecId3 Sell  100 User1 Company1
      OrdId2  SecId3 Sell  200 User3 Company2
      OrdId3  SecId1 Buy   300 User2 Company1
      OrdId4  SecId3 Sell  400 User5 Company2
      OrdId5  SecId2 Sell  500 User2 Company1
      OrdId6  SecId2 Buy   600 User3 Company2
      OrdId7  SecId2 Sell  700 User1 Company1
      OrdId8  SecId1 Sell  800 User2 Company1
      OrdId9  SecId1 Buy   900 User5 Company2
      OrdId10 SecId1 Sell 1000 User1 Company1
      OrdId11 SecId2 Sell 1100 User6 Company2

      SecId1 900
      SecId2 600
      SecId3 0
